# vscode-floyd-language-support

> This is an extension for the code editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that adds language support for the programming language [Floyd](http://oliver-berse.de/). Floyd is used to write classical Text Adventures (in German).

## Features

The Floyd language extension currently only adds basic syntax highlighting. For the future many more features are planned, like more complex syntax highlighting, code intellisense, code completion, help for built-in functions etc.

### Syntax Highlighting
Very basic syntax highlighting is applied to `.floyd` Floyd source code files. It introduces colors for strings, numbers, line and block comments and all available keywords.

> Example from Nebelmond (Oliver Berse, 2002-2003) using the Dark+ color theme:
