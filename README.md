# vscode-floyd-language-support
> This is an extension for the code editor [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that adds language support for the programming language [**Floyd**](http://oliver-berse.de/). **Floyd** is used to write classical Text Adventures (in German).

> You can find out about the current development by visiting the [extension repository on GitHub](https://github.com/PythooonUser/vscode-floyd-language-support/).

## Features
The **Floyd** language extension currently adds basic syntax highlighting. For the future many more features are planned, like more complex syntax highlighting, code intellisense, code completion, help for built-in functions, a language server etc.

### Syntax Highlighting
Basic syntax highlighting is applied to `.floyd` **Floyd** source code files. It introduces colors for comments, literals, all available keywords, class and function declarations etc.

> Example from Nebelmond (Oliver Berse, 2002-2003) using the Dark+ color theme:
